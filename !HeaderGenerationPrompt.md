Simulate the C++ source code generation in your mind. The simulated generation of C++ source code should correspond to the header files generated in the previous responses above. Run this internal mental simulation of C++ source code generation until all source code is generated. While generating C++ source code, make note of any and all issues, problems, and concerns that you encountered, no matter how minor or seemingly irrelevant / inconsequential. After the simulation of C++ source code generation has completely finished, bring your listing of items back to this real world and provide to me a listing of how the C++ header files may need to be modified, added, or removed to the codebase.
Note: "CPL_Commands.md" and "Showcase.html" are available for reference in the file system. The legacy and reference "JAdmin" Java source code is available under directory "JAdmin", and the new "CAdmin" C++ source code should maintain at minimum, full functional parity with this Java source code. The device driver source code that is known to work and provides the target public APIs for the new CAdmin device interface driver source code is given under directory "DeviceInterfaceDriver".
When writing to files with extension ".hpp" or ".cpp", write to the same file but with ".txt" appended to the extension: for example, write to file "Device.hpp.txt" instead of "Device.hpp".
